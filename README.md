### Cameras Discovery:

- Its a fork from @futomi/node-onvif which is a Node.js module, allows you to communicate with the network camera which supports the ONVIF specifications.
- I have added support for searching via other mechanicsms like UPnP,mdns,port number based to get list of all potential cameras.

- Idea is to convert it from a library to a quickly-digestible tool including some other handy services & discovery options.

TLDR
Local run
- bash ./run.sh

Example docker Usage:
Docker pull
```sh
docker pull saurabhshandy/camerasdiscovery
```
